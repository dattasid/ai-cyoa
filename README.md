Generate Choose Your Own Adventure narratives using AI

This project is for creating choose your own adventure games using AI. The games will be static, ie once created they will not need to connect to AI or internet to play.

Note that since these games are static, they will not support text input. Player must select next step from a set of choices.

[Why static games? Why not dynamic live games, where AI can take any adventure in any direction the player wants?](docs/WhyNotDynamic.md)

[First attempt: Low supervision binary tree with random pruning.](docs/FirstBinary.md)
